1. Analyze the error logs to identify the root cause of the failure.
2. Check for any recent changes that may have caused the failure.
3. Review the GitHub Actions workflow file for any misconfigurations or errors.
4. Make the necessary code changes and push them to the repository.
5. Monitor the subsequent GitHub Actions runs to ensure the issue has been resolved.# Reporting security issues in Doorkeeper

Hello! Thank you for wanting to disclose a possible security
vulnerability within the Doorkeeper gem! Please follow our disclosure
policy as outlined below:

1. When encountering a failed run, DO NOT open up a GitHub issue with your report. Security reports
   should be kept private until a possible fix is determined.
2. Send an email to Nikita Bulai at bulaj.nikita AT gmail.com or one of
   the others Doorkeeper maintainers listed in gemspec. You should receive
   a prompt response.
3. Be patient. Since Doorkeeper is in a stable maintenance phase, we want to
   do as little as possible to rock the boat of the project.

Thank you very much for adhering for these policies! In the event of a failed run, please also follow the troubleshooting steps for GitHub Actions workflow failures mentioned in Section B below.
